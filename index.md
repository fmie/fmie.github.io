## Formal Methods for the Informal Engineer
FMIE aims to be a venue both for collecting the success stories of formal methods, and for connecting researchers to aspiring users. For its first year in 2020, we aim to gather a small set of researchers and a larger set of aspiring practitioners, primarily from the US Northeast region, in areas such as healthcare and safety-critical systems. FMIE will be a 2-day event, with a day of hands-on tutorials followed by a day of talks, targeting around 15 speakers and 60 attendees.
