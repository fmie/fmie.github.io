## Formal Methods for the Informal Engineer
Due to economic incentives, exponential growth of multi-modal data sources, and challenging biomedical problems, the life sciences are becoming not only leading consumers of AI technologies, but also a driver of new insights, algorithms, and architectures. The next 5 -10 years will be a critical growth phase for this process and provide an opportunity to shape the software engineering culture from the ground up.

Safety and security, realized through both informal and formal methods, are central to this goal. Consider the range of software systems and potential points of failure in automated medical diagnosis.  Underlying safety concerns range from biases in training data, to errors in implementing ML algorithms, to security of identifiable patient data, to access control for medical devices. Automation of medical diagnosis is just one of a range of software advances transforming the life sciences, spanning genomics, cell biology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medicine, and healthcare. Recent advances in applying formal methods in widely deployed software — including the TLA+ specification language on AWS and the seL4 verified microkernel from Data61 — suggest that biomedical software can benefit from formal methods and can build upon existing verified components. 

Formal Methods for the Informal Engineer (FMI) aims to be a venue for collecting the success stories of formal methods, exploring potential avenues for formal methods in the life sciences, and connecting researchers to aspiring users. By educating a group of mathematically sophisticated developers, many of whom have transitioned to the life sciences from computational PhDs, we will accelerate the diffusion of this knowledge into the ecosystem of biomedical software development. On the first day, we will have hands-on tutorials with two different verification technologies, the Coq and Z3 theorem provers.  This will provide the audience with exposure to basic concepts of verification.  On the second day, we will have four tracks on General Topics, Verified Software Components, Formal Methods and Machine Learning, and Distributed Systems.
