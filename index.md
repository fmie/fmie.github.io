Due to economic incentives, exponential growth of multi-modal data sources, and challenging biomedical problems, the life sciences are emerging as both leading consumers of AI technologies as well as drivers of new insights, algorithms, and architectures. The next 5 -10 years will be a critical growth phase for this process and provide an opportunity to shape the software engineering culture from the ground up. Safety and security, realized through both informal and formal methods, are central to this goal. 

Formal Methods for the Informal Engineer (FMIE) is a workshop aimed at highlighting recent success in the development of verified software. On the first day, to accommodate an audience consisting of many interested non-experts, we will have hands-on tutorials with two different verification technologies, the Coq and Z3 theorem provers. This will provide the audience with exposure to basic concepts of verification. The second day will feature four sessions on General Topics, Verified Software Components, Robust Machine Learning, and Distributed Systems. 

Ultimately, our aim is to further the development of reliable software systems by creating a venue for collecting the success stories of formal methods, exploring potential applications to real-world software development, and connecting researchers to aspiring users. Although FMIE was initially conceived with a view towards ongoing developments in the life sciences, the topics and speakers we have selected are domain-agnostic. We welcome participants from any arena in which the development of robust software systems would be impactful.
