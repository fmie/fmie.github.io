FMIE is a two-day event and participants are welcome to attend either or both days. Please sign-up using the following [registration form](https://forms.gle/zqD3JSojs4fJuaDT8) and indicate which of the days you are interested in attending as well as your background and interest in formal methods and theorem proving technologies.

We hope to accommodate all participants, but due to capacity and desire for a diverse community, 
registration will be confirmed in early February.
