FMIE is a two-day event and participants are welcome to attend either or both days. Please sign-up for the workshop using the following [registration](https://forms.gle/zqD3JSojs4fJuaDT8) [form](https://forms.gle/zqD3JSojs4fJuaDT8) and indicate which of the days you are interested in attending as well as your background and interest in formal methods and theorem proving technologies.
